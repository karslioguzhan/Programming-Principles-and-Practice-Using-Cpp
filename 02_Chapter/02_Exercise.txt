Expanding on what you have learned, write a program that lists the instructions for a computer to find the upstairs bathroom, discussed in §2.1. Can you think of any more steps that a person would assume, but that a computer would not? Add them to your list. This is a good start in “thinking like a computer.” Warning: For most people, “go to the bathroom” is a perfectly adequate instruction. For someone with no experience with houses or bathrooms (imagine a stone-age person, somehow transported into your dining room) the list of necessary instructions could be very long. Please don’t use more than a page. For the benefit of the reader, you may add a short description of the layout of the house you are imagining.

    1: Stand up
    2: Walk around the table
    3: Walk straight until you see the stairs
    4: Walk each step upstairs

    9: Close door with pushing it to the door frame
