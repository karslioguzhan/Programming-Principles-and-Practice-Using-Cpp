Execute this program yourself using a piece of paper. Use the input "The cat cat jumped." Even experienced programmers use this technique to visualize the actions of small sections of code that somehow donâ€™t seem completely obvious.


Program variables

    1'st run:
        previous = " "
        current = "The"
        console output = /

    2'nd run:
        previous = "The"
        current = "cat"
        console output = /

    3'rd run:
        previous = "cat"
        current = "cat"
        console output = "repeated word: cat"
        previous = "cat"
    4'th run:
        previous = "cat"
