// 18_Exercise.cpp : Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of the form
// ax2 + bx + c = 0
// If you don’t know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression, do some research. Remember, researching how to solve a problem is often necessary before a programmer can teach the computer how to solve it. Use doubles for the user inputs for a, b, and c. Since there are two solutions to a quadratic equation, output both x1 and x2.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
}
