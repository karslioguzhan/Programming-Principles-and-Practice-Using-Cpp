// 07_Exercise.txt : Write a grammar for bitwise logical expressions. A bitwise logical expression is much like an arithmetic expression except that the operators are ! (not), ~ (complement), & (and), | (or), and ^ (exclusive or). Each operator does its operation to each bit of its integer operands (see ยง25.5). ! and ~ are prefix unary operators. A ^ bind tighter than a | (just as * binds tighter than +) so that x |y^z means x|(y^z) rather than (x|y)^z. The & operator binds tighter than ^ so that x^y&z means x^(y&z).
