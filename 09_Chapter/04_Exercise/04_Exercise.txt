4.Look at the headache-inducing last example of ยง8.4. Indent it properly and explain the meaning of each construct. Note that the example doesn't do anything meaningful; it is pure obfuscation.

Code from section:
// dangerously ugly code
struct X {
void f(int x){
struct Y{
inf f() {return 1;} int m;}
int m;
m=x;
m=x; Y m2;
return f(m2.f());}
int m; void g(int m){
if (m) f(m+2); else {
g(m+2);}}
X() {} void m3(){
}
void main() {
X a; a.f(2);}
};

Conclusion:
    - Because of lacking indention and writing mostly in same line the code is aweful to read
    - Naming of the types are also not best practice because it is unknown what the intention of the code or functions is
    - Most IDEs have automaticly style guides which should be used or style guides from best practices like google styleguide should be used for consistency
