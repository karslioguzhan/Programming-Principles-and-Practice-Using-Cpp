1. Why is  I/O tricky for a programmer? 
    - I/O is tricky because there are many different data types and the interpretation can vary alot.
    - For example 1234 can be understood as ints 1, 2, 3,4; as chars or as the string "1234"
    - Because of that it is not always trivial what the person or data meant with given out or input

2. What does the <<hex do?
    - This is a I/O manipulator which changes the output of the I/O stream
    - For example the integer 255 would be displayed as FF in hex.


3. What are hexadecimal numbers used for in computer science? Why?
    - Because two characters in hex like FF are exactly one  byte (8 bit) and the readablity of a hex stream is better

4. Name some of the options you may want to implement for formatting integer outputs.
    - I probably will use showbase to easier determine which reprensentation the int is

5. What is a manipulator?
    - A manipulator changes the behavoir of a stream

6. What is the prefix for decimal? For octal? For hexadecimal?
    - decimal -> std::dec
    - octal -> std::oct
    - hexadecimal -> std::hex

7. What is the default output format for floating-point values?
    - std::defaultfloat is the default, which is also known as general format

8. What is a field?
    - Fiels specify how many characters an integer or string will occupy
    - For that we use the function "set field width" -> setw()

9. Explain what setprecision() and setw() do.
    - setprecision() is a manipulator for floating point, regarding of reprensentation 
        - defaultfloat -> precision is the total number of digits
        - scientific -> precision is the number of digits after the decimal point
        - fixed -> precision is the number of digits after the decimal point
    - setw() specify how many characters a output will have 
        - Prints 1234 when setw(2) is setted, because data will not be cutted

10. What is the purpose of file open modes?

11. Which of the following manipulators does not "stick": hex, scientific, setprecision(), showbase, setw?

12. What  is the difference between character I/O and binary I/O?

13. Give an example of when it would probably be beneficial to use a binary file instead of a text file?

14. Give two example where a stringstream can be useful?

15. What is a file position?

16. What happens if you position a file position beyon the end of file?

17. When would you prefer line-oriented input to type-specific input?

18. What does isalnum(c) do?
