source code                             Is the code that is written by a human to tell the computer what it should be do.
statement                               A statement is an complete instruction which is executed. It ends with an semicolon

variable                                A variable is a named object with type.
definition                              Is a declaration that sets aside memory for an object.
Initialization                          Giving a variable its initial value
Assignment                              Giving a variable a new value

Decrement                               Subtraction of 1 from the value of an variable --> --num

Name                                    Is the name of an object.
Narrowing                               Are unsafe conversion where a bigger object is put to an smaller object. double to int
Operation                               Are the operation which can be used for types.
Operator                                Are functions that do operation like ==
Type                                    Are the type of an object, which describes how the memory should be interpreted
Type safety                             A Program is typesafe when objects only used according to the rules of their type.
Value                                   Is a set of of bits in memory which interpreted according to a type.
Abstraction                             Hiding details we don't need to use facility (implementation details) behind a convenient and general interface.
begin()                                 Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the vector.
Computation                             The act of producing a result (output) from arguments (input) using a function (computation).
Conditional statement                   A Conditional statement is for example a if-statement where the program runs a set of particular statements depending if the condition is true.
Divide and conquer                      We understand by Divide and conquer that we divide complex computations into smaller functions and call them one by one.
else                                    If the "if" condition is not true than the statements inside the else will be computed.
end()                                   The C++ function std::vector::end() returns an iterator which points to past-the-end element in the vector container.
expression                              A expression computes a value from a number of operands. Simple expressions are literal values like 10 or "Norah". A variable represents a expression to like: int length = 20;
for-statement                           A for-statement iterate n-times till the condition is not longer met. You should use for, when you know how many times you want to iterate
range-for-statement                     Also called foreach iteration. This statement will run for all elements of an container.
function                                A function is a named sequence of statements.
if-statement                            A if-statement where the program runs a set of particular statements depending if the condition is true.
Increment                               With using a increment we can add 1 to an variable. We know pre and post increments.
Input                                   Also called an argument which is used for example in functions that is necessary for the computation.
Iteration                               Also called Repetition and with an iteration we can execute the same statements multiple times.
Loop                                    In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
lvalue                                  An lvalue is for short a value that appears on the left side of an operand and mostly the one value that will be modified. 
member function                         Also called methods are functions that are functions defined inside a class. A example is the begin() member function for the container vector.
output                                  A output is the result of an computation which is provided after a program or functions runs. 
push_back()                             The push_back() member-function puts an new value in the end of the vector.
Repetition                              Identical to Iteration.
rvalue                                  The complement to lvalue is rvalue, that is, an expression that identifies something that may not be modified or have its address taken, such as a value returned from a function (&f(x) is an error because f(x) is an rvalue).
selection                               Under selection we understand the possibility to compute different statements regarding of an state. With selections we allow our program to have multiple paths.     
size()                                  The size member function give the size of an container.
sort()                                  Is defined inside the header algorithm and sorts a container in ascending order.               
switch-statement                        A switch-statement is like an if-statement but is used if you have many possible selections.
vector                                  A vector is a container that is defined in the STL. It can store elements and its half open. You can expand the vector at the end. The advantage of a vector is, that its know its size and does boundary checking when you try to access a variable.
while-statement                         A while statement is a iteration which performs the same statements until a specified condition is not longer met.
