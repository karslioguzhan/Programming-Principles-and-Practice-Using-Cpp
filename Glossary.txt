variable                                A variable is a named object with type.
definition                              Is a declaration that sets aside memory for an object.

Operator                                Are functions that do operation like ==
Type                                    Are the type of an object, which describes how the memory should be interpreted
Type safety                             A Program is typesafe when objects only used according to the rules of their type.
Value                                   Is a set of of bits in memory which interpreted according to a type.
Abstraction                             Hiding details we don't need to use facility (implementation details) behind a convenient and general interface.
begin()                                 Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the vector.
Computation                             The act of producing a result (output) from arguments (input) using a function (computation).
Conditional statement                   A Conditional statement is for example a if-statement where the program runs a set of particular statements depending if the condition is true.
Divide and conquer                      We understand by Divide and conquer that we divide complex computations into smaller functions and call them one by one.
else                                    If the "if" condition is not true than the statements inside the else will be computed.
end()                                   The C++ function std::vector::end() returns an iterator which points to past-the-end element in the vector container.
expression                              A expression computes a value from a number of operands. Simple expressions are literal values like 10 or "Norah". A variable represents a expression to like: int length = 20;
for-statement                           A for-statement iterate n-times till the condition is not longer met. You should use for, when you know how many times you want to iterate
range-for-statement                     Also called foreach iteration. This statement will run for all elements of an container.
function                                A function is a named sequence of statements.
if-statement                            A if-statement where the program runs a set of particular statements depending if the condition is true.
Increment                               With using a increment we can add 1 to an variable. We know pre and post increments.
Input                                   Also called an argument which is used for example in functions that is necessary for the computation.
Iteration                               Also called Repetition and with an iteration we can execute the same statements multiple times.
Loop                                    In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
lvalue                                  An lvalue is for short a value that appears on the left side of an operand and mostly the one value that will be modified. 
member function                         Also called methods are functions that are functions defined inside a class. A example is the begin() member function for the container vector.
output                                  A output is the result of an computation which is provided after a program or functions runs. 
push_back()                             The push_back() member-function puts an new value in the end of the vector.
Repetition                              Identical to Iteration.
rvalue                                  The complement to lvalue is rvalue, that is, an expression that identifies something that may not be modified or have its address taken, such as a value returned from a function (&f(x) is an error because f(x) is an rvalue).
selection                               Under selection we understand the possibility to compute different statements regarding of an state. With selections we allow our program to have multiple paths.     
size()                                  The size member function give the size of an container.
sort()                                  Is defined inside the header algorithm and sorts a container in ascending order.               
switch-statement                        A switch-statement is like an if-statement but is used if you have many possible selections.
vector                                  A vector is a container that is defined in the STL. It can store elements and its half open. You can expand the vector at the end. The advantage of a vector is, that its know its size and does boundary checking when you try to access a variable.
while-statement                         A while statement is a iteration which performs the same statements until a specified condition is not longer met.
argument error                          Argument errors are when the arguments that are given to a function/program are false. This can lead to errors which the compiler can catch or worse logic errors which only can be tested.
assertion                               A statement that states (asserts) an invariant is called an assertion.
catch                                   The catch statement handle exceptions, like out_of_range etc.
compile-time error                      Compile time errors occurs when the compiler gets errors like syntax or type errors. 
container                               A Container is in the standard library a holder objects that stores a collection of other objects(elements).
debugging                               Debugging is the art of finding and removing all kinds of errors.
error                                   A error can be understand as an misbehave of your function/program. 
exception                               Exceptions provide a way to react to exceptional circumstances (like runtime errors) in programs by transferring control to special functions called handlers.
invariant                               In OOP, an invariant is a set of assertions that must always hold true during the life of an object for the program to be valid.
link-time error                         Are errors that occurs when the linker tries to link the compiled files.
logic error                             Are errors that leads to false results but the compiler and linker does not catch it.
post-condition                          Post conditional checks are checks for testing if a result of an program/function is legit.
pre-condition                           Pre conditional checks are checking if the arguments that are passed to the program/function are legit.
range error                             A range errors occurs when you try to get or set to an element of an container which doesn't exist.
requirement                             Requirements can be understand as the necessary things that should considered when writing a software. 
run-time error                          Occurs when the program is correctly compiled and linked and the program returns error while running. Like for example you try to divide with zero. 
syntax-error                            A Syntax error is a compile time error where the compiler checks if the syntax of c++ is respected. For example missing semicolon.
testing                                 The testing is performed after you build your program with a set of selected inputs and their outputs.
throw                                   Is an expression which signals an erroneous condition and executes an error handler.
type error                              A Type error is a compile time error where the type mismatches. For example you try to insert a string to an function which requires an int.
code layout                             Defines how the source code is designed and is split into logical units
error handling                          Defines how errors get caught and what to do after a error occurs. Likewise a char is inserted instead of required integer  
feature creep                           Defines the activity to add more and more features into a project that can be dangerous for finishing the project with the resources that are available
maintenance                             Is the modification of code after finishing the project. For example this can be necessary if a security leak is found or changes in the compiler version.
recovery                                Allows to retain code if incorrectly changes occurs
revision history                        Show the changes that ware committed (usage of a source control management software like git is recommended)
scaffolding                             Is how the project is designed, but it can mean the techniques like code generation and project generation too.
symbolic constant                       Symbolic constants are nothing more than a label or name that is used to represent some fixed value that never changes throughout the course of a program.
