This is the glossary which is written by Oguzhan Karsli, while learning with the book: Programming Principles and Practice Using C++

Name                                    Description
//                                      A Command

C++                                     The programming language used in this book
comment                                 Comments are for humans which describes what the intention of the program or code is for example
compiler                                The Compiler translates the source code to machine code.
compile time error                      The errors that occur while compiling the source code. For example syntax errors.
cout                                    A function from iostream which outputs characters
executable                              The program that is executable for the Operating system you compiled for.
function                                Is a set of instructions which have an return type, name, parameters and function body
header                                  Header files are files that we include in our programs to use codes from others or own.
IDE                                     Integrated Development Environment 
#include                                This line includes Header files
library                                 A Libary is a collection of function XXX
linker                                  The linker links machine codes to an executable
main()                                  The entry point of every C++ Program
object code                             Is the code that is generated from the compiler, which can be read from a computer
output                                  Output means like printing characters into your console etc.
program                                 Is the set of instruction which does an task what it is designed for.
source code                             Is the code that is written by a human to tell the computer what it should be do.
statement                               A statement is an complete instruction which is executed. It ends with an semicolon
prompt                                  A request for example inserting a char or number into command prompt
object                                  A Object is some memory that holds a value of a given type
variable                                A variable is a named object with type.
definition                              Is a declartion that sets aside memory for an object.
Initialization                          Giving a variable its initial value
Assignment                              Giving a variable a new value
cin                                     Is method for character input in the terminal
Concatenation                           Is the adding of two string or objects together
Conversion                              Is the changing from one type to an another
Declartion                              Is a statement that gives a name to an object.
Decrement                               Subtraction of 1 from the value of an variable --> --num
Increment                               Addtion of 1 to the value of an variable --> ++num
Name                                    Is the name of an object.
Narrowing                               Are unsafe conversion where a bigger object is put to an smaller object. double to int
Operation                               Are the operation which can be used for types.
Operator                                Are functions that do operation like ==
Type                                    Are the type of an object, which describes how the memory should be intepreted
Type safety                             A Program is typesafe when objects only used according to the rules of their type.
Value                                   Is a set of of bits in memory which intepreted according to a type.
