# Chapter 2: Hello, World!
1. What is the purpose of the "Hello World!" program!
    * It shows a very basic program which outputs the text Hello World and moves the cursor one line under. 
    It should show the learner the syntax etc.

2. Name the four parts of a function.
    * Return type
        * Show what the function should return
    * Name
        * The name of the function
    * Parameters
        * Are the input Parameters which the function needs to return
    * Function body
        * Are the set of instruction the function calls

3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program.
    * The main function must appear in every C++ program. Because it is the entry point of the program.

4. In the "Hello World!" program, what is the purpose of the line return 0;?
    * The return 0 indicates that the program runs successfully to the end.

5. What is the purpose of the compiler?
    * The compiler translates the C++ code written by human to computer readable code, which is called machine code.

6. What is the purpose of the #include directive? 
    * The includes are the codes which is written from someone else that we are using. Like stdio (standard input output)

7. What does a .h suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?
    * The .h shows that this is a header file.

8. What does the linker do for your program?
    * The linker links the object codes from the includes and the written ones into the executuble.

9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?
    * The source file is file which is coded by a human and the object file is the translation of it to machine code.

10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?
    * The IDE (Integrated Developement Environment) is a tool for writing code with features like code highlighting etc. 
    * The IDE also do the compiling and linking job for the user.

11. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice?
    * Like every skill based activity programming need practice to refine and learn the skill. 
    * It is necessary to learn from errors, which only possible if someone codes for its own.
